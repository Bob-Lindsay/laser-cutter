    # One of the key "tricks" that this algorithm applies, is that it converts everything into
    # pure set of lines in the end. It then tries to find all intersections of the lines so that
    # we can remove duplicates.  So any segment of any line that is covered by 2 lines or more is removed,
    # cleared completely for an empty space.  This turns out to be very useful indeed, because we can
    # paint with wide brush strokes to get the carcass, and then fine tune it by adding or removing line
    # segments.  Some of the lines below are added to actually remove the lines that might have otherwise
    # been there.
    #
    # This comes especially handy when drawing corner boxes, which are deliberately made not to match the notch
    # width, but to match thickness of the material.  The corner notces for these sides will therefore have
    # length equal to the thickness + regular notch length.
